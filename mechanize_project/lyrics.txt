    
  [Verse 1]In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
[Verse 2]
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
[Chorus]We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[Verse 3]
And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next doorAnd the band begins to play
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]Full speed ahead, Mr. Parker, full speed ahead
Full speed over here, sir
Action station, action station
Aye, aye, sir, fire
Heaven, heaven
[Verse 5]
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we needSky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
[Chorus]
